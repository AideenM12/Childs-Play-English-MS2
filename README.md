# UX

## Strategy

### User Stories
* As a first time user I want to learn basic English vocabulary with the aid of intuitive visual images/graphics.

* As a first time user I want to recieve feedback when I interact with the purposely built interactive parts of the site.

* As a first time user I want to intuitively navigate the site to find my desired vocabulary topic with relative ease.

* As a first time user I want to be able to learn vocabulary that is fitting for the level of beginner.

* As a first time user I want to be able to be intuitvely aware of when I have made an error in order to aid my learning.

* As a returning user I want to be able to repeat the proscribed learning material in order to boost familiarity with the new vocabulary and aid the learning process.

* As a returning user I want to boost the learning process by encountering the same visual graphics in order to assist in the memorisation of the vocabulary.
