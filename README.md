# UX

## Strategy

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the project is to create a site for younger, non-english speaking, learners to learn some basic English vocabulary in a stress-free playful environment. Younger learners enjoy repetitive material and respond better to praise than to new challenges so the site will be designed with this in mind. The material will be easy in order to encourage learners and the graphics used will be consistent with what is attractive to the target audience. The vocabulary chosen is food, animals and clothing because often learners in non English speaking countries are presented with certified English speaking exams that often involve being able to identify this vocabulary when presented with images so the site can function as an effective study aid in order to make the process of learning and studying much less daunting and hopefully much more enjoyable.

**The Ideal User of this site is:**
* Aged 5+ or a younger child with excellent reading skills.
* Someone who enjoys languages and learning new things.
* Someone who has regular access to a phone or computer with internet connection.
* Someome who has been in enrolled in a ESL oral exam such as Trinity's GESE 1 exam.  

### User Stories
* As a first time user I want to learn basic English vocabulary with the aid of intuitive visual images/graphics.

* As a first time user I want to recieve feedback when I interact with the purposely built interactive parts of the site.

* As a first time user I want to intuitively navigate the site to find my desired vocabulary topic with relative ease.

* As a first time user I want to be able to learn vocabulary that is fitting for the level of beginner.

* As a first time user I want to be able to be intuitvely aware of when I have made an error in order to aid my learning.

* As a returning user I want to be able to repeat the proscribed learning material in order to boost familiarity with the new vocabulary and aid the learning process.

* As a returning user I want to boost the learning process by encountering the same visual graphics in order to assist in the memorisation of the vocabulary.
