# UX

## Strategy

### Project Goals

The primary goal of the project is to create a site for younger, non-english speaking, learners to learn some basic English vocabulary in a stress-free playful environment. Younger learners enjoy repetitive material and respond better to praise than to new challenges so the site will be designed with this in mind. The material will be easy in order to encourage learners and the graphics used will be consistent with what is attractive to the target audience. The vocabulary chosen is food, animals and clothing because often learners in non English speaking countries are presented with certified English speaking exams that often involve being able to identify this vocabulary when presented with images so the site can function as an effective study aid in order to make the process of learning and studying much less daunting and hopefully much more enjoyable. Given the fact that the site is designed with English language learners in mind the amount of text outside of the target language will be minimal in order to not overwhelm, confuse or distract the user. The lack of text outside the target language will also promote a positive emotional response because of the site's ease of use and the relaxed presentation of the target language.

**The Ideal User of this site is:**
* Aged 5+ or a younger child with excellent reading skills.
* Someone who enjoys languages and learning new things.
* Someone who has regular access to a phone or computer with internet connection.
* Someome who has been in enrolled in an English as a Foreign Language oral exam such as Trinity's GESE 1 exam.  

### User Stories
* As a first time user I want to learn basic English vocabulary with the aid of intuitive visual images/graphics.

* As a first time user I want to recieve feedback when I interact with the purposely built interactive parts of the site.

* As a first time user I want to intuitively navigate the site to find my desired vocabulary topic with relative ease.

* As a first time user I want to be able to learn vocabulary that is fitting for the level of beginner.

* As a first time user I want to be able to be intuitvely aware of when I have made an error in order to aid my learning.

* As a returning user I want to be able to repeat the proscribed learning material in order to boost familiarity with the new vocabulary and aid the learning process.

* As a returning user I want to boost the learning process by encountering the same visual graphics in order to assist in the memorisation of the vocabulary.

# Structure

## Features

### Footer
The footer code was used twice to alter the display on different screen sizes.

### Design
**Colours**

Two color palettes were chosen for this project. The pastel palette was chosen to tone down the colorful nature of the site to prevent it from appearing too garish whilst also being vibrant enough to appeal to the target audience. 

<img src="documentation/doc-images/ms2pastels.png" width="450" height="250" alt="milestone palette one">

The second palette was chosen for the more interactive parts of the site to highlight the navigation bar and footer whilst also employing simple shades of black and white for various sections of text. The green and red colors were chosen for their vibrancy but more importantly because green can indicate to a non English speaking audience that they have selected a correct answer whilst red is a universal indicator of error.

**Typography**

The 'Chewy' and 'Chilanka' fonts were found on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were chosen because of their child-like and cartoonish qualities to appeal to a junior audience.  

**Imagery**

The imagery was found on the [FreePik Website](https://www.freepik.com/). It was chosen based on its suitablity for the target audience and also for its use of color which is similar to the color palettes selected for the site.
